Upload the contents of the SIM2Wiki to a webserver running PHP (tested on Apache 2.4.6 and PHP 5.5.3) and visit the URL in your browser. No additional libraries outside what is already provided by most distributions are required.

SIM2Wiki is likely to work with PHP 5.1 >, however for security reasons unrelated to SIM2Wiki it is recomended that a newer version is used.
